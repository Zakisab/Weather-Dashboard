# Module 8 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## My Task was to make Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. My challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Using the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. 

The base URL for your API calls should look like the following: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys.

My api_keys= 070029ea04f217d781d16e739055a5b4


## User Story

```text
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## I Created a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city


The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
